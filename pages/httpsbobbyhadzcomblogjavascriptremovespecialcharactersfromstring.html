e.g. str.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]/g, '');. The replace method will return a
new string that doesn't contain any special characters.index.jsCopied!const str = 'hello 123 !@#$%^WORLD?.';

const noSpecialCharacters = str.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]/g, '');
console.log(noSpecialCharacters); // üëâÔ∏è 'hello 123 WORLD'
The first parameter we passed to the
String.replace
method is a regular expression.We used the g (global) flag to match all occurrences of the regex in the string and not just the first occurrence.The square brackets [] part denotes a character class and the caret ^
symbol means "not the following characters".After the ^ (not) symbol we specify:ranges for lower (a-z) and upper case (A-Z) letters. This only applies to the
Latin alphabet.a range for digits from (0-9)a space characterIn its entirety, the regular expression matches all characters but lower and uppercase letters, digits and spaces.If you need to exclude other characters from being matched, add them between the
square brackets [] of the regular expression.If you don't know the syntax for a specific character, check out the
MDN regex syntax cheatsheet.We could also shorten the regular expression by using the \w character.index.jsCopied!const str = 'hello 123 !@#$%^WORLD?._';

const noSpecialCharacters = str.replace(/[^\w ]/g, '');
console.log(noSpecialCharacters); // üëâÔ∏è 'hello 123 WORLD_'
This is slightly different then our previous example because the \w character
matches:ranges for lower (a-z) and upper case (A-Z) letters. This only applies to the
Latin alphabet.a range for digits from (0-9)underscoresA very convenient way to check what a specific character matches is to look at
the
MDN cheatsheet.If you need to exclude other characters from being removed, add them between the square brackets of the regex.However, note that the caret ^ symbol has to be the first character in the
square brackets to mean "not the following characters".If you pass the caret ^ later in the regex, it will get interpreted literally
as the ^ symbol.Note that the String.replace method does not change the original string. Instead, the method returns a new string with the matches replaced.Further Reading #Check if String contains Special Characters in JavaScriptRemove all Spaces from a String in JavaScriptReplace all Numbers in a String using JavaScriptRemove all Numbers from a String in JavaScriptRemove Empty Strings from an Array in JavaScriptRemove Empty String Values from an Object in JavaScriptRemove all non-alphanumeric Characters from String in JSInterpolate Variable in a String in JavaScriptI wrote a book in which I share everything I know about how to become a better, more efficient programmer.You can use the search field on my Home Page to filter through all of my articles.ShareShareShareShareShareBorislav HadzhievWeb DeveloperTwitterGitHubLinkedinSUPPORT ME : ) AboutContactsPolicyTerms & ConditionsTwitterGitHubLinkedinCopyright ¬© 2022 Borislav HadzhievSearch for posts0..................................................................................................................................................................
